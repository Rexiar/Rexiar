### Hi there, i'm Ditya aka Rexiar!ðŸ‘‹
I am an undergraduate Information Engineering student at Gadjah Mada University in Indonesia. I really like figuring out and solving problems, thus this is why I like programming. I take pride whenever I get up after failing (I fail alot haha).
My hobby is gaming. I play all sorts of games, including First Person Shooters, Puzzles, and Open World games. Games are a really big part of my life.
